## Price Analysis and Data Cleaning Project 
The project can be considered intermediate to advanced for someone with a solid understanding of data analysis and visualization in Python. It involves several key areas:

	1. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values:
		* Tasks: Identifying and filling missing values, dropping specific dates.
		* Techniques: Backward filling (using bfill), checking for NaNs, visual inspection.
	2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
		* Tasks: Visualizing data distributions, calculating statistics, identifying outliers.
		* Techniques: Histograms, KDE plots, rug plots, joint plots, linear regression plots.
	3. Statistical Analysis:
		* Tasks: Calculating variance, standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR), and applying the empirical rule.
		* Techniques: Using statistical measures to identify outliers and validate data.
	4. Data Visualization:
		* Tasks: Plotting data distributions, cumulative distributions, and filtered data.
		* Techniques: matplotlib, seaborn, and different plot types like histograms, KDE plots, and regression plots.
